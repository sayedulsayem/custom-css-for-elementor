### **Required Tools**

### **How to Use Custom CSS for Elementor**

First of all, it’s a plug-and-play tool. You will not get any setting page. So, after installing the Custom CSS for Elementor tool, just navigate to any Elementor Widget editing panel, then jump on the Advanced tab section; you will get a new accordion of Custom CSS for Elementor. Unfold the accordion, and you will get three different fields to write CSS codes for your widgets. If you want to show different designs for different devices, choose the device panels according to your needs. 

Direction: Edit any Elementor Widget > Advanced Tab > Custom Css for Elementor

Note: According to general CSS logic, if you write CSS for a bigger screen (Desktop), it will be automatically implemented on smaller devices chronologically. If you want to change anything for a smaller screen, you have to write different CSS for smaller screens. 

In our Custom CSS for Elementor addon, if you want to add global CSS, just write CSS code in the desktop/global panel, and the code will be automatically implied to the other screen. If you want to change the CSS for Tablets, you have to write different CSS in our Tablet CSS panel. And same goes for mobile devices. If you want to change the CSS for Mobile devices, write different CSS in the Mobile CSS panel of our tool. 

Don’t forget to check the Screenshots below to get a clear overview of the tool.
